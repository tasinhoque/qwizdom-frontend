## Quiz Creation

- Add stage and question header (i.e. number).
- Fix the image preview (the aspect ratio should be preserved)
- Add points to each of the questions
- CSS fixing
  - Make the cards look similar to the cards in the figma design.
  - Textfields should have the texts in the center (currently there is a top margin)
  - Question text-field type should be changed (at least set it to outlined)
- The user should be able to toggle the radio button/checkbox/toggle button before saving his option. Ideally, there should be an "Add Option" button at the right side of the text-field for adding the option.

## Edit Quiz

- Keep an edit button in the quiz home for the creator. That button will redirect to the edit quiz page.
