# Create React App example

## How to use

Install it and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It includes `@material-ui/core` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in Material-UI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
